<h3>Christian Anderskov here, Hi!</h3>

> 33 years of age at present, Started my education in 1999 so been involved with IT in one way or another for the past 18 years, after finishing my education I've spent most of my time in Operations, Starting with Windows, moving to Linux, and lately moving to development, Primarily .NET. With a side of bash / power-shell scripting when something needed some quick and dirty automation. 

> Ive build a NOC screen solution for work, which via a .NET app probes the json output of a Icinga server, and displays that on screens with green, yellow and red, And most recently setup Influxdb for collecting site activity metrics, and Server health / performance stats to be displayed in grafana.
